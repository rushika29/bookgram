    <p>Justin has a curse, and thanks to a Reddit thread, it's now all over the internet. Every woman he dates goes on to find their soul mate the second they break up. When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work.

        <p>Silent Patient</p>
        <p>Author:Alex Michaelides</p>
        <p>A grisly murder, a woman trapped in her own mind, and a therapist trying to get to the bottom of her secrets—there's not much more to love in Alex Michaelides' THE SILENT PATIENT. This is an extremely well-done debut thriller, very worthy of all the meaning well praise I know it is going to receive. Reading more like a character study than a psychological thriller, THE SILENT PATIENT is nothing so much than a maze-like exploration into the psyches of both a woman convicted of murdering her husband and a therapist hellbent on treating her. Michaelides's tremendous first novel—the power of its overall effect—resides not in mile-a-minute pacing or whiplash-inducing twists but in the masterfully methodical building—and breaking down—of his characters by the author. In much the same way that his protagonist investigates and reveals the mental state of his subject, so, too, does Michaelides methodically reveal to his readers the psychology of the characters upon which THE SILENT PATIENT is built. It is not a crime what is being investigated in THE SILENT PATIENT but the mind of a criminal; and what a riveting investigation it is. THE SILENT PATIENT is immersive and hypnotic-the type of confidently drawn suspense story which doesn't require big, flashy twists to keep you hooked…but it delivers an exceptional twist or two anyway. Believe the hype: THE SILENT PATIENT shall very well be the debut crime novel of the season.</p>

    <p>Icebreaker</p>
    <p>Author:Hannah Grace</p>
    <p>All her life, Anastasia Allen has waited for this very moment: the chance to be part of Team USA. Things seem to be really slowly falling into place when she gets a full scholarship at the University of California, Maple Hills, and another on its competing figure skating team.

        Nothing will stand in her way, not even the captain of the hockey team, Nate Hawkins.
        
        As captain, Nate needs to keep his team on the ice, and he will do anything to achieve that. Now this gets really tricky when a facilities mishap means his team has to share the rink with the figure skating team, including Anastasia, who obviously hates his guts.
        
        And if the questionable future of Anastasia's skating partner means she has to look to Nate for her shot, things just might turn out all right.
        
        Sparks Fly. .. and Anastasia isn't worried. She could never like a hockey player, right?</p>

    <p>Don Quixote</p>
    <p>Author:Miguel de Cervantes
    </p>
    <p>Enamored of reading chivalric romances, Don Quixote decides to become a knight-errant himself. With the help of his trusty squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits develop most wonderfully. Where Quixote's fancy often gets him away—ftyling at windmills, thinking them giants—Sancho gains cunning and a kind of sagacity. Madman-sage and wise fool, the two wander the world together, and together they haunt the imagination of readers for nearly four hundred years.

        With its form of experimentation and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has generally been accredited as the first modern novel ever written. It is enormously influential on a lot of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and even Faulkner, who read it once a year, "just as some people read the Bible."</p>
